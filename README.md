## Hi there 👋

**datawithibrahim/datawithibrahim** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Hey there.

I’m Ibrahim Shaikh, a junior business analyst currently pursuing an MBA in Operations & Data Science from NMIMS Global.

I’m working toward becoming a data/business analyst who does more than write queries or build dashboards. My focus is on understanding how businesses actually work — how revenue is generated, where it leaks, and how data should support decisions.

I’m building skills across both technical and business areas, because effective analysis sits at the intersection of data, context, and decision-making.

On the technical side, I work with SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Python.  
On the business side, I focus on problem framing, KPI design, and translating analysis into clear business insights.

I’ve worked on projects related to:
- Revenue leakage analysis  
- Revenue optimization  
- Sales and customer behavior analysis  

I’m also building a master repository called **Business Case Book** — a growing collection of real-world-style business problems and analyses that reflect how I approach learning and problem-solving as an analyst.
